\chapter{Ornaments on dependently typed descriptions}\label{chap:simple}

The sum-of-products descriptions of \fref{chap:sop} can be extended to
support dependent types. In the |_⊗_| constructor we used a |Set| to
indicate which type that argument has. To encode dependent types, we
want to allow this type to be determined by using a local
environment. Arguments are thus encoded as a function from the
environment |γ| to a |Set|. Using the definitions in the upcoming
sections, the description of lists will look like this:

\begin{code}
listDesc : (A : Set) → DatDesc 2
listDesc A = ι ⊕ (λ γ → A) ⊗ rec-⊗ ι ⊕ `0
\end{code}

A typical use case for dependent types is in the usage of
predicates. For instance, if the |IsLessThan7| predicate states that a
given number is lower than 7, the type |Σ Nat| |IsLessThan7| contains a
natural which is lower than seven. This can be encoded as a
description, where |top γ| is used to refer to the only value in the
environment |γ|.

\begin{code}
IsLessThan7 : Nat → Set
IsLessThan7 n = n < 7

lt7Desc : DatDesc 1
lt7Desc = (λ γ → Nat) ⊗ (λ γ → IsLessThan7 (top γ)) ⊗ ι ⊕ `0
\end{code}

All the lambda-abstractions and parentheses make the syntax quite hard
to read. McBride \cite{mcbride10} presents a solution; SKI combinators
can do the hard work of plumbing the environment through the
terms. Applicative functors are a generalisation of SKI
combinators \cite{mcbride08} and they may be more familiar to
functional programmers who are not into combinator calculus, so we
will be writing our terms in an applicative functor style using
|_<S>_| for the S combinator, |const| for the K combinator and
|_<KS>_| as a combination of |const| and |_<S>_|. With these
combinators, as defined in \fref{lst:simple-combinators}, the
following expressions are all equal:

\begin{codelst}{Combinators for terms with environments}{simple-combinators}\begin{code}
-- The S combinator
_<S>_ : ∀ {a b c} {Γ : Set a} {S : Γ → Set b} {T : (γ : Γ) → S γ → Set c} →
  (f : (γ : Γ) (s : S γ) → T γ s) → (s : (γ : Γ) → S γ) → (γ : Γ) → T γ (s γ)
f <S> s = λ γ → f γ (s γ)

_<KS>_ : ∀ {a b c} {Γ : Set a} {S : Set b} {T : S → Set c} →
  (f : (s : S) → T s) → (s : (γ : Γ) → S) → (γ : Γ) → T (s γ)
f <KS> s = const f <S> s
\end{code}\end{codelst}

\begin{code}
  fxy₁ fxy₂ fxy₃ : (γ : ⟦ Γ ⟧) → String
  fxy₁ = λ γ → f (x γ) (y γ)
  fxy₂ = const f <S> x <S> y
  fxy₃ = f <KS> x <S> y
\end{code}

The definition of |lt7Desc| can be modified to use these combinators.
The first argument did not use the environment, so we can use
|const| to always return |Nat|. In the second argument, the
pure function |IsLessThan7| is applied to a |top| which does use the
environment.

\begin{code}
lt7Desc′ : DatDesc 1
lt7Desc′ = const Nat ⊗ IsLessThan7 <KS> top ⊗ ι ⊕ `0
\end{code}

Of course, an environment can contain more than one value. The
environment is basically a stack of values, where |pop| and |top| can
be used to pick one. The behavior is like DeBruijn indices
\cite{debruijn72}: |top| means variable 0, |top ∘ pop| means variable
1, |top ∘ pop ∘ pop| means variable 2 and so forth. In the following
example we assume that a predicate |IsShorter| of type |List A → Nat →
Set| exists which says that some list is shorter than some length. The
description |shorterDesc| describes a type with one constructor which
contains a |Nat| and a |List A| such that they satisfy the
predicate.

\begin{code}
IsShorter : {A : Set} → List A → Nat → Set

shorterDesc : ∀{A} → DatDesc 1
shorterDesc {A} = const (List A) ⊗ const Nat ⊗
  IsShorter <KS> top ∘ pop <S> top ⊗ ι ⊕ `0
\end{code}

When descriptions support dependent types, ornaments must do so as
well. We upgrade our ornaments to take contexts into account. One has
to consider how the insertion or removal of arguments changes the
context of the tail, and how the context can be used to insert
arguments with types which can be dependent on earlier arguments. As a
somewhat contrived example, we define an ornament on |lt7Desc| which
inserts a |Fin n| argument, where |n| is the value of the first
argument. Note how the |isLessThan| predicate now uses the second
DeBruijn index.

\begin{code}
lt7-insertFin : DatOrn lt7Desc
lt7-insertFin = -⊗ Fin <KS> top +⊗ -⊗ ι ⊕ `0

test-lt7-insertFin : ornToDesc lt7-insertFin ≡
  (const Nat ⊗ Fin <KS> top ⊗ IsLessThan7 <KS> top ∘ pop ⊗ ι ⊕ `0)
test-lt7-insertFin = refl
\end{code}

In this chapter, we will start by showing how environments are exactly
implemented. Descriptions are upgraded to support the propagation of
environments in \fref{sec:simple-descriptions} and ornaments receive
their upgrade in \fref{sec:simple-ornaments}.

\section{Contexts and environments}

An environment |γ| must contain a stack of values, but what is the
type of |γ|? The type has to mention the types of all the variables
and each of those types should be able to use the values of the
previous variables. For the purpose of building types of environments
we define |_▶_|, which is a left-associative version of |Σ| where
|fst| is renamed to |pop| and |snd| to |top|
(\fref{lst:simple-env}). We can start with |⊤| as the empty
environment, and extend it to the right with |_▶_| to add a
variable. For each variable, an environment |γ| containing values for
all variables to the left of it can be used. For example, if we want
to write the type of an environment containing the variables |(xs :
List A)|, |(n : Nat)| and |(p : IsShorter xs n)|, we could write it
like this:

\begin{codelst}{Definition of |_▶_|}{simple-env}\begin{code}
record _▶_ {a b} (A : Set a) (B : A → Set b) : Set (a ⊔ b) where
  constructor _,_
  field
    pop : A
    top : B pop
\end{code}\end{codelst}

\begin{code}
ShorterEnv : {A : Set} → Set
ShorterEnv {A} = ⊤′ ▶₀ const (List A) ▶₀ const Nat ▶₀
  IsShorter <KS> top ∘ pop <S> top
\end{code}

The basic types |_▶_| and |⊤| can contain an environment, but it is
not a very structured approach. For integration into our universe of
descriptions we will build a universe of contexts. The contexts decode
to |_▶_|'s and |⊤|'s. The definition is given in
\fref{lst:simple-cx}. This is quite a common approach to encode
contexts \cite{danielsson2007, mcbride10}. While we are at it, we also
define |_▷′_| as a shortcut when a variable does not need to use the
context. With these definitions we can create a context which, when
decoded, is equal to the |ShorterEnv| type we defined before.

\begin{codelst}{|Cx| definition and semantics}{simple-cx}\begin{code}
mutual
  data Cx : Set₁ where
    _▷_ : (Γ : Cx)(S : (γ : ⟦ Γ ⟧Cx) → Set) → Cx
    ε : Cx

  ⟦_⟧Cx : Cx → Set
  ⟦ Γ ▷ S ⟧Cx = ⟦ Γ ⟧Cx ▶ S
  ⟦ ε ⟧Cx = ⊤′

_▷′_ : (Γ : Cx) → Set → Cx
Γ ▷′ S = Γ ▷ const S
\end{code}\end{codelst}

\begin{code}
ShorterCx : {A : Set} → Cx₀
ShorterCx {A} = ε ▷′ List A ▷′ Nat ▷ IsShorter <KS> top ∘ pop <S> top

test-ShorterCx : ∀{A} → ⟦ ShorterCx {A} ⟧ ≡ ShorterEnv {A}
test-ShorterCx = refl
\end{code}

When we need to disambiguate between types and values in the remainder
of this thesis, we will be using the following terminology:

\begin{itemize}
\item \emph{Contexts} are usually indicated by |Γ| or |Δ|. They
\item An \emph{environment} is a specific instantiation of a context,
  containing inhabitants of the types which were indicated by the
  context. They are written as |γ| of type |⟦ Γ ⟧| or |δ| of
  type |⟦ Δ ⟧|.
\end{itemize}

\section{Descriptions}\label{sec:simple-descriptions}

For now we will be assuming that all |DatDesc|s are closed, i.e. they
do not refer to free variables. The |ConDesc|s which are directly
contained within the |DatDesc| have to be closed too, so a |DatDesc|
is essentially a list of closed |ConDesc|s. Not all |ConDesc|s have to
be closed though, because within a constructor new types are added to
the context. The context is chained through from left to right and
whenever a |_⊗_| operator is encountered, the specified type is added
to the context of the |ConDesc| which forms the tail.

In \fref{lst:simple-desc} we see how this works. The |DatDesc|
datatype specifies that each constructor starts with an empty context
|ε|. In the type of |_⊗_| we see that a |S| of type |⟦ Γ ⟧ → Set| must
be given. The value of |S| basically specifies a type which can depend
on the current context |Γ|. The context |Γ| is extended with |S|, and
this forms the context for the |ConDesc| in the tail |xs|.

\begin{codelst}{Descriptions with contexts}{simple-desc}\begin{code}
data ConDesc (Γ : Cx₁) : Set₁ where
  ι : ConDesc Γ
  _⊗_ : (S : (γ : ⟦ Γ ⟧) → Set) → (xs : ConDesc (Γ ▷ S)) → ConDesc Γ
  rec-⊗_ : (xs : ConDesc Γ) → ConDesc Γ

data DatDesc : Nat → Set₁ where
  `0 : DatDesc 0
  _⊕_ : ∀{#c}(x : ConDesc ε)(xs : DatDesc #c) → DatDesc (suc #c)
\end{code}\end{codelst}

Ideally, we would also add recursive arguments to the context, but
this is not possible with our current implementation. One would have
to extend the context in the |rec-⊗_| constructor with the fix point of
the whole description, but the whole description is not available at
during the definition of |ConDesc|.

The semantics of |ConDesc| now requires an environment before a
pattern functor can be delivered. The new semantics is given in
\fref{lst:simple-semantics}. For the |_⊗_| constructor, the
environment is applied to |S| to obtain the definitive type of that
argument. The semantics of |DatDesc| is only changed slightly to pass
the empty environment |tt| to |⟦_⟧conDesc|.

\begin{codelst}{Semantics of |ConDesc| with contexts}{simple-semantics}\begin{code}
⟦_⟧conDesc : ∀{Γ} → ConDesc Γ → ⟦ Γ ⟧ → Set → Set
⟦ ι ⟧conDesc γ X = ⊤
⟦ S ⊗ xs ⟧conDesc γ X = Σ (S γ) λ s → ⟦ xs ⟧conDesc (γ , s) X
⟦ rec-⊗ xs ⟧conDesc γ X = X × ⟦ xs ⟧conDesc γ X
\end{code}\end{codelst}

\begin{example}
We can now describe all the types from the introduction of this
chapter. To gain some insight in how the contexts are propagated and
extended we will also give a step-by-step example of how dependent
pairs (the |Σ| type) are described. We start by specifying the type,
which is parameterised by |A| and |B|, as the |Σ| type always is:

\begin{code}
pairDesc : (A : Set) (B : A → Set) → DatDesc 1
\end{code}

By using Agda's refine command, the |_⊕_| and |ε| are automatically
filled in. In the remaining hole, a closed |ConDesc| is expected.

\begin{code}
pairDesc₁ A B = ?0 ⊕ `0
-- |?0 : ConDesc ε|
\end{code}

When we add an argument of type |A| with |_⊗_|, the context of the
rest of the constructor is extended with the type |A|. Remember that
|ε ▷′ A| is defined as |ε ▷ const A|.

\begin{code}
pairDesc₂ A B = const A ⊗ ?1 ⊕ `0
-- |?1 : ConDesc (ε ▷′ A)|
\end{code}

We refine the hole with the |_⊗_| constructor and |ι| to finish the
list of arguments. Leaving us with the hole for the type of the second
argument. The required type tells us that the local context is |ε ▷′
A|. When the semantics is expanded we get the corresponding type |⊤′
▶₀ const A|, which is the type of the environment which contains the
value of the first argument.

\begin{code}
pairDesc₃ A B = const A ⊗ ?2 ⊗ ι ⊕ `0
-- |?2 : ⟦ ε ▷′ A ⟧ → Set|
-- |?2 : ⊤′ ▶₀ const A → Set|
\end{code}

Finally, we give |B ∘ top| as the implementation of the hole,
resulting in a description of dependent pairs.

\begin{code}
pairDesc A B = const A ⊗ B <KS> top ⊗ ι ⊕ `0
\end{code}

According to \fref{sec:sop-descriptions}, an isomorphism between |Σ A
B| and |μ (pairDesc A B)| should be given to be certain that this is
the right description. Doing that is honestly quite boring, so we will
just show that the definition is not \emph{entirely} wrong by giving
one half of the embedding-projection pair (one of the four functions
in the isomorphism).

\begin{code}
pair-to : {A : Set}{B : A → Set} → Σ A B → μ (pairDesc A B)
pair-to (x , y) = ⟨ 0 , x , y , tt ⟩
\end{code}
\end{example}

In the previous chapter, |conDescmap| and |datDescmap| both went from |⟦ D
⟧ X| to |⟦ D ⟧ Y|. With contexts built-in the semantics of |ConDesc|
requires an environment and the type of |conDescmap| is updated
accordingly to accomodate all contexts and all environments. The type
of |datDescmap| does not change and the implementations of both
functions still look the same. The types and definitions of |fold|
and |Alg| do not have to change either.

\begin{code}
datDescmap : ∀{#c X Y} (f : X → Y) (D : DatDesc #c) →
             (v : ⟦ D ⟧ X) → ⟦ D ⟧ Y
conDescmap : ∀{Γ X Y} (f : X → Y) (D : ConDesc Γ) →
             ∀{γ} → (v : ⟦ D ⟧ γ X) → ⟦ D ⟧ γ Y
\end{code}

\section{Ornaments}\label{sec:simple-ornaments}

Contexts can be changed when ornaments are applied, as was shown in
the introduction of this chapter. We add some parameters to the |ConOrn|
datatype to store the starting context |Γ| and the resulting context
|Δ|. This means that the ornament goes from a |ConDesc Γ| to a
|ConDesc Δ|. To implement the ornamental algebra later on, we also
have to be able to calculate the original environment from an
environment of the ornamented type. That is, a function from |δ : ⟦ Δ
⟧| to |⟦ Γ ⟧| is required which we will call the \emph{environment
  transformer}. We will be working with functions between environments
a lot, so an alias |Cxf Γ Δ| is defined to mean |⟦ Γ ⟧ → ⟦ Δ ⟧|. The
environment transformer is a parameter of |ConDesc| as well. This
gives us the following types:

\begin{code}
Cxf : (Γ Δ : Cx) → Set
Cxf Γ Δ = ⟦ Γ ⟧ → ⟦ Δ ⟧

DatOrn : ∀{#c}(D : DatDesc #c) → Set₂
ConOrn : ∀{Γ Δ} (f : Cxf Δ Γ) (D : ConDesc Γ) → Set₂
\end{code}

We are not aware of any previous work which implemented ornaments on
datatypes with contexts like these. The treatment of them is however
very similar to how indices are treated usually in ornament
\cite{dagand14-transporting}\todo{cite some more}. Specifically in how
a function from the ornamented thing to the original thing is used as
a parameter for the ornament. In fact, the next chapter will show how
indices and contexts can be implemented in exactly the same way.

The new definition of ornaments is given in full in
\fref{lst:simple-ornament}. An ornament is always told from the
outside what its environment transformer |c| is. This is seen in the
|_⊕_| constructor, where |id| is used as the environment transformer
for |ConOrn|. The first arguments to |_+⊗_| and |give-K| can both
depend on an environment, just like the first argument of the |_⊗_|
description. Both of them use the new environment |Δ|.

Every ornament is responsible for providing the right transformer to
its children. Ornaments like |rec-⊗_| do not change the context of the
rest of its tail and do not introduce additional changes to the
environment, so |c| is simply passed along. The |_+⊗_| ornament
extends the context with |S|, meaning that the tail ornament has to go
from context |Γ| to |Δ ▷ S|. The tail ornament must be given an
environment transformer of type |Cxf (Δ ▷ S) Γ|, while we already have
|c| of type |Cxf Δ Γ|. This transformer is given by |cxf-forget| in
\fref{lst:simple-cxf}. The other ornaments which update the context
use similar functions to produce environment transformers for their
tails.

\begin{codelst}{Ornaments with contexts}{simple-ornament}\begin{code}
data ConOrn {Γ Δ} (c : Cxf Δ Γ) : (D : ConDesc Γ) → Set₂ where
  ι : ConOrn c ι
  -⊗_ : ∀{S xs} → (xs⁺ : ConOrn (cxf-both c) xs) → ConOrn c (S ⊗ xs)
  rec-⊗_ : ∀{xs} → (xs⁺ : ConOrn c xs) → ConOrn c (rec-⊗ xs)

  _+⊗_ : ∀{xs} → (S : (δ : ⟦ Δ ⟧) → Set) →
    (xs⁺ : ConOrn (cxf-forget c S) xs) → ConOrn c xs
  rec-+⊗_ : ∀{xs} → (xs⁺ : ConOrn c xs) → ConOrn c xs

  give-K : ∀{S xs} → (s : (γ : ⟦ Δ ⟧) → S (c γ)) →
    (xs⁺ : ConOrn (cxf-inst c s) xs) → ConOrn c (S ⊗ xs)

data DatOrn : ∀{#c}(D : DatDesc #c) → Set₂ where
  `0 : DatOrn `0
  _⊕_ : ∀{#c x xs} →
    (x⁺ : ConOrn id x) (xs⁺ : DatOrn xs) → DatOrn {suc #c} (x ⊕ xs)
\end{code}\end{codelst}

\begin{codelst}{Environment transformers}{simple-cxf}\begin{code}
Cxf : (Γ Δ : Cx) → Set
Cxf Γ Δ = ⟦ Γ ⟧ → ⟦ Δ ⟧

cxf-both : ∀{Γ Δ S} → (c : Cxf Δ Γ) → Cxf (Δ ▷ (S ∘ c)) (Γ ▷ S)
cxf-both c δ = c (pop δ) , top δ

cxf-forget : ∀{Γ Δ} → (c : Cxf Δ Γ) → (S : ⟦ Δ ⟧ → Set) → Cxf (Δ ▷ S) Γ
cxf-forget c S δ = c (pop δ)

cxf-inst : ∀{Γ Δ S} → (c : Cxf Δ Γ) → (s : (γ : ⟦ Δ ⟧) → S (c γ)) → Cxf Δ (Γ ▷ S)
cxf-inst c s δ = c δ , s δ
\end{code}\end{codelst}

The rest of the definitions relating to ornaments do not differ much
from the previous chapter. The interpretation function of ornaments on
constructors, |conOrnToDesc|, now works for all contexts and
environment transformers:

\begin{code}
conOrnToDesc : ∀{Γ Δ}{c : Cxf Δ Γ}{D : ConDesc Γ} →
               ConOrn c D → ConDesc Δ
\end{code}

The implementation of |conOrnToDesc| is the same, except that the
environment transformer is used in the |-⊗_| ornament. When we
try to produce a description with |_⊗_|, we have to give a function |⟦
Δ ⟧ → Set| representing a type within the ornamented context |Δ|. The ornament
stored the type within the original context: |S| of type |⟦ Γ ⟧ →
Set|. The environment transformer |c : Cxf Δ Γ| helps us to transform
types within the context |Γ| to types with the context |Δ|:

\begin{code}
conOrnToDesc {c = c} (-⊗_ {S = S} xs⁺) = S ∘ c ⊗ conOrnToDesc xs⁺
\end{code}

We have seen in \fref{sec:sop-ornalgs} how the ornamental algebra for
an ornament |o| on a description |D| was built using a natural
transformation from the pattern functor of |o| to the pattern functor
of |D|. With contexts, we have to provide an environment before we get
a pattern functor for a description of a constructor, so the natural
transformation must go from the pattern functor |⟦ conOrnToDesc o ⟧ δ|
to |⟦ D ⟧ γ| for a suitable environment |γ|. By assuming that we know
the environment |δ|, we can calculate the right |γ| by applying the
environment transformer:

\begin{code}
conForgetNT : ∀{Γ Δ}{c : Cxf Δ Γ}{D : ConDesc Γ} →
              (o : ConOrn c D) →
              ∀{δ X} → ⟦ conOrnToDesc o ⟧ δ X → ⟦ D ⟧ (c δ) X
\end{code}


% \begin{itemize}
% \item Right vs left nesting (see mcbride10: outrageous but meaningful coincidences).
% \item Compare with Σdescs: Σ can also support dependent types, but
%   with a Σ constructor the description of the tail is given as a
%   result of a function. Stuff like |countArguments| is not
%   possible. We have essentially taken the things which allow Σdescs to
%   support dependent types and moved those inside the contexts.
% \item Something about encoding |_×_| in Σ and ours?
% \end{itemize}
